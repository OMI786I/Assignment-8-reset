    "review": "1984 is a dystopian novel that presents a terrifying vision of a totalitarian future. The story is set in a world where the government, led by the Party and its leader Big Brother, exercises total control over every aspect of life. Through the protagonist, Winston Smith, Orwell explores themes of surveillance, propaganda, and the suppression of individual thought.
